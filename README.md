# WhatsAppWebChatRestricter
A JavaScript code for the WhatsApp Web page that serves to restrict the visibility of chats and other parts for certain specific cases.

***Object:** Make WhatsApp Web to show only chosen chats to user and hide other chats and **counterproductive parts (i.e. search bar, change profile or exit from WhatsApp Web)***.

***My scenario:** My little sister's school classes have own WhatsApp chat groups and all the school messages (homeworks etc.) are sending to them. Therefore we must follow them every day and when I'm busy I can't focus them enough. So I open my WhatsApp Web in PC of home and customise the code to show only school chat groups and don't allow any other operations (except send messages to groups). So this isn't a secure way to share your WhatsApp account with possible malicious person. The purpose is make your whatsapp account usable by a harmless person without being distracted from other chats or features.*

This is a special project that appeals to a very small audience. Therefore I made an image to describe what it is do.

**This picture shows the standard page of WhatsApp Web**

You will find a list top of the script. The chats to be shown are assigned here. You can inject the code with any code injector extension with your internet browser. *(Preferred: Code Injector extension by L.Sabatelli)*
